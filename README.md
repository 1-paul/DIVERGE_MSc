# MSc Project: Gene-Environment Interaction of Early Life Adversity and Depression in Pakistan
All the scripts needed for my MSc project analysing major depressive disorder (MDD) in Pakistan as part of the DIVERGE study. First for analysis of the phenotypic data, as well as identifaction of risk factors, and then running and visualising the GWAS and GxE analysis.

## Demographics
- Creating a map of the collection points in Pakistan (Maps_Script.py)

## Environmental risk factors
- Cleaning of the DIVERGE questionnaire dataset (00 script)
- Quality control for the definition of early life adversity (01 and 02 scripts)
- Evalutation of early life adversity as a risk factor (03 script)

## Genetic risk factors
- Preparing and running the GWAS (05.1, 05.2, and 06 scripts)
- Extraction of significant variants and GWAS plots (07 script)

## Gene-environment interaction analyis
- Preparing and running the gene-environment interaction analyis (08 and 09 scripts)
- Extraction of significant variants and GxE plots (10 script)
